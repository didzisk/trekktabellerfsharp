# trekktabellerfsharp
This is an F# port of https://github.com/Skatteetaten/trekktabell, written in Java (and the earlier COBOL code).

Currently this has become a hobby project as I no longer work in Visma.

I'm adding some Java files here for reference. Those are aligned and often modifed to my needs (I'm not a Java programmer and I often struggle to simply get the Java project to run),
don't expect them to be identical to the original. 

And by the way, the only reason I add them is to see the diff in git. If the guys from Skatteetaten would push their work along the way, I wouldn't need to do this, because there would be a commit with last years code, which is then transformed with this year's modifications.

Here is the site, which helped me to set up Java environment in VSCode: https://vaadin.com/learn/tutorials/vs-code-for-java-and-maven-projects
